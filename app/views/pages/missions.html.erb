	The mission of the Wild Plant ID is to design, build, deploy, and maintain a 
	software application template which enables amateurs to accurately identify wild 
	plants in individual ecologically defined areas using pocketable computing devices.

    There are three objectives which make this app unique among both printed and digital 
    field guides. In these three critical objectives the application is to be:
    </p>

    <p>
    1. Customizeable - The application will be adaptable so that any interested individual 
    or group would be able to create a Wild Plant ID application of their own, ecologically defined area.
    </p>

    <p>
    2. Comprehensive - Including all native and naturalized, field-identifiable plants 
    including wildflowers, ferns, and trees any place in the watershed. Only plants too 
    small for field identification will not be included.
    </p>

    <p>
    3. Exclusive - Including only plants found in a limited, specific watershed. You 
    won't have to wade through identifying plants not found in your watershed.
